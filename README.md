Community
===
This app provides a community space for people
 to write posts, read other's posts,
  and comment on posts from other members.

This is an app to reinforce what I have learned in [Tealeaf Academy]
(http://www.gotealeaf.com)'s second course
 [Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails]
(http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!rails).
